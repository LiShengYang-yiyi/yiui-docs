# Effect system (yiuieffect)

## Overview
- This document describes the Effect system (yiuieffect) used in the YiUI ecosystem to model, configure, and apply visual and behavioral effects across UI and gameplay elements.
- The extraction of concrete components, systems, enums, and configs from the source package is pending in this environment. Replace placeholder lists with actual items after source analysis.

## Package Structure
- Core
- Effects
- Configs
- Utils
- Integrations
- Tests (if present)

*Note:* The actual package structure should reflect the source folders; update after running the extraction step.

## Source Stats
- Total C# source files: N/A in this environment
- Representative file: N/A
- Last modified: N/A
